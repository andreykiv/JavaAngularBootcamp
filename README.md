# Activities Unit 9 JavaAngularBootcamp

#### 1. Description
```
Those activities were made in order to practice a concept of Inheritance in Java. Notions such as
Interfaces and Abstract Class were used in the creation of some of those exercices. 

For instance, exercice 2 makes use of an Interface "Entregable" which is implemented in 
classes "Serie" and "Videojuego". Each of those classes share the same methods stated within 
the interface, those methods were expanded inside their own class.

Exercices 1 and 6 from this unit were made in a team of 3 members.
Each exercice has it's own repository with a description of an exercice and members of the team.
