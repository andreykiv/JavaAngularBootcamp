# Activities Unit 8 JavaAngularBootcamp

#### 1. Description
```
The activities of this unit were a mere introduction of Object Oriented Programming. Notions such us 
creation of a class, declaration of it's atributes, creations of it's GETTERS and SETTERS were put 
into practice. 

It's worth noting that Eclipse IDE allows you to genereate getters&setters, constructors,
and toString method automatically. With a simple shortcut Alt+Shift+S you can choose 
what do you want to generate inside the class which is very helpful.

Important to mention that all activities are within one project. Meaning that there is a method main within each
exercice.
