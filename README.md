# Activities Unit 22 JavaAngularBootcamp

#### 1. Description
```
In this unit the main goal was to practice the creation of a MVC (Model Views Controller) architecture.

Each of the exercices follows the MVC architecture which consists of three clearly defined parts of a 
program which are models, controller and views. Views doesn't have any logic implemnented but only a visual
part that user is interacting with. Controller connects the logic of the app with the views. Finally, models
represent the data of an app with it's methods that allow to interact with that data. 
Each of the models is divided by three parts: 
- DAO (data access object) is the part where the methods that allow interact with the database are defined. 
- DTO (data transfer object) a part where each of the data entities is represented by it's own class. 
- Service - methods of validators that validate the inputs of the user before sending it to DAO. 

Within models package there is also included Connection package which is the part that represents the 
connection with the database.
