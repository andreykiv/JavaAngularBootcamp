# Activities Unit 9 Part III JavaAngularBootcamp

#### 1. Description
```
This exercice consists of a program that enables the creation of different types of vehicles (bike, truck and car) as well as 
two types of people (driver, vehicleHolder). 
Program doesnt finish until the user chooses to finish it (via Scanner input). 
Each time when a user creates a vehicle or one type of people, a list of created vehicles and people shows up with complete
information about the created Object. 

The structure of classes is as follows:
Each vehicle share most of its attributes that were inherited from a superclass Vehicle. Same goes for people, which inherit from 
Persona superclass. 

It was also requested a creation of two validator methods:

# First one to check if the vehicle registration plate has a specific format of 4 digits+ 2 or 3 letters (regex 
was used to verify this condition).
# Second one to verify if the diameter of the wheel matches specific length range. 

Given exercice had 3 stages (milestones) that were completed following instructions of the exercice.
