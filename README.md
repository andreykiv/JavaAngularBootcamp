# Activities Unit 7 JavaAngularBootcamp

#### 1. Description
```
Those activities were made with a purpose to practice topics such as ArrayLists and Hashtables.
In addition to the new concepts, notions from previous units were also heavily used (e.g. iteration, usage of 
class methods, import java packages).

Last exercice (Actividad4) was built using methods and practices that were created in previous exerices 
adding some new features. For instance, stock is generated randomly following this type 
of structure: {"itemName":[itemPrice, itemQuantity, VAT]}.

Important to mention that all activities are within one project. Meaning that there is a method main within each
exercice.
