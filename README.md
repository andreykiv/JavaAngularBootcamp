# Activities Unit 18 JavaAngularBootcamp

#### 1. Description
```
The goal of the unit was to implement a connection between mySQL server and Java.

Each of the exercices has it's own mySQL database, which is based on a server located
remotly. Creation of the server was done using tools such us Virtual box and Fedora 33 (Server Edition).

Once connection was established through the driver that Java offers to it's users (mysql-connector-java)

a valid registers that respects data constraints.
