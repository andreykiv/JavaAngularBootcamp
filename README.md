# Activities Unit 20 JavaAngularBootcamp

#### 1. Description
```
The main goal of the unit was to get used to an implementation of Maven projects within Eclipse IDE. 
Each of the Maven projects has it's own pom.xlm file which is the file where all the dependencies of the
project are linked into.

Besides the implementation of Maven, Java's interface library such as Java Swing/AWT was heavily used 
in each of the exercise.
