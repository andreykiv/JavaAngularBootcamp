# Activities Unit 6 JavaAngularBootcamp

#### 1. Description
```
Those activities were made with a purpose to practice topics such as creation of Methods and Arrays in Java.
In addition to the new concepts, notions from previous units were also heavily used (e.g. iteration, usage of 
class methods, import java packages).

Important to mention that all activities are within one project. Meaning that there is a main class within each exercice.
