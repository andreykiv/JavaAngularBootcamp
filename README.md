# Activities Unit 25 JavaAngularBootcamp

#### 1. Description
```
In this unit the goal was to create a basic CRUD project with it's end-points using maven
and Spring Tool Suite 4 IDE. 
The difference between exercices from this unit and from the previous one is that in this unit there is two 
entities that have a relation of OneToMany and ManyToOne. 

H2 imbedded Database was also of a big help when doing the task. It automatically creates a fresh database 
specified in data.sql file when the App is launched.
